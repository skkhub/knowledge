## 自我介绍
> 我的名字叫孙可可，今年30岁。我2014年毕业于北京的一所大学。毕业后先后在创业公司、互联网大厂任职，做前端开发工程师。我开发过pc端页面、移动端页面、小程序，也用node做过服务端开发。最近的一份工作是在腾讯，主要负责weishi app业务的开发工作。由于业务线调整，我不得不找一份新的工作。这一次，我希望能求得一份稳定的工作，做一些之前没有做过的事情，最好能拓宽自己的视野。我认为外企是一个好选择。所以我过来面试了。

## 英文自我介绍
> My name is Elwin Sun. I am 30 years old. I've graduated from a university in Beijing in 2014. After graduation, I successively worked as a front-end development engineer in a startup company and a large internet company. I have developed PC pages, mobile pages, small programs, and server development with Node. My recent job was at Tencent, where I was mainly responsible for the development of Weishi APP business. Because of the business change, I had to look for a new job. This time, I hope to get a stable job and do something I have never done before. It's better to broaden my horizon. I think a foreign company is a good choice. So I'm here for the interview. Thanks for giving me this chance.
