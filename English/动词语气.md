# 动词的语气
> 注意是动词的语气

## 陈述语气
> 描述现实
## 祈使语气
> 请求、命令
### 窍门：
- 用第二人称、一般现在时态表达
- 去掉第二人称，并保证动词原形
- You eat the carrot -> Eat the carrot
- You don't eat it -> Don't eat it
- You are quite -> Be quite
- You never give up -> Never give up

## 虚拟语气
> 如果描述的是脑中的想象，主观意愿，尤其是与事实相反
### 表示和现在事实相反
条件句：过去式
主句：would + 动词原形
> 如果是be动词，一定用were，不能是was，不管第几人称
- If I saw the rabbit now, I would bite him.
> 如果我现在看到那只兔子，我会咬他
- If I see the rabbit tomorrow, I will bite him.
> 这句是陈述语气（条件语气）
### 表示和将来事实相反或可能性很小的动作/事件
条件句：were to + 动词原形
条件句：should + 动词原形
主句：would + 动词原形
主句：should + 动词原形
主句：could + 动词原形
主句：might + 动词原形
一般式 ->  过去式
shall -> should
will -> would
can -> could
may -> might
- If I should see the rabbit tomorrow, I would bite him.
### 表示和过去事实相反
条件句：had + 动词过去分词
主句：would have + 动词过去分词

### 表达愿望 请求 建议 命令等

#### 对现在的愿望
