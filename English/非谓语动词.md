to + 动词原形
> 一般表将要发生的动作
it is + 形容词 + for sb. + to do sth.

- let
做谓语动词时，后边的动词不定式要省略to

- 表结果

### 高级用法
- 将不定式和状态结合

## 动名词

### 做主语

### 做表语

### 做定语
> 说明事物的性质、用途等
a sleeping pill
> sleeping 是名词

### 做宾语

look forward to 
> to 是介词，不是动词不定式的to，经典易考的概念

## 现在分词
> 与“现在”无关
### 做形容词
a sleeping pill. // 一片帮助睡眠的药 sleeping是动名词
a sleeping rabbit. // 一只睡觉的兔子 sleeping是现在分词
动词+ing构成现在分词，可以当形容词
